# Figuri-Geometrice
OOP School Project


A hierarchy of classes representing geometric shapes (dot, segment and rectangle).



'Figura' is the base class. 

  'Punct' (dot) extends 'Figura' and is represented by 2 integers (x and y coordinates).

  'SegmentVe' and 'SegmentOr' (vertical/horizontal segment) both extend 'Figura' and use a pair of dots. 

  'Dreptunghi' (rectangle) extends 'Figura' and uses a pair of segments (Ho & Ve) and a dot (upper right dot).




Every shape is identified by a unique unsigned integer ID.
